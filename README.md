Hey, I'm Eugen 👋

I am a software engineer with a passion for the Java ecosystem, Spring, REST APIs, and, of course, security. 
Nowadays, I’m focused on running Baeldung 💻, creating video courses 📹, helping the Java community 😀, and doing quite a bit of OAuth work 🔐. 

I'm generally hangging around on Twitter.

Cheers, 
Eugen :)
